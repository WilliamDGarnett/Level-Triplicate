Similarity and Difference:

One similarity that I noticed across Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot was one of the ways that you can import assets into the games. The way I prefer to add assets into game engines is by dragging and dropping them into the folder in engine that I want them in. I was pleased to find that each of the engines allows you to drag and drop your files into the engine with minimal hoops and hurdles to jump through. One of the main differences that I noticed was the pipeline for building my levels. For Unity I basically put each object in first and then assembled it by parenting objects and creating prefabs where I needed to. For Unreal I found it was easiest to create my blueprints first, that way I can have my parented objects and just build the level using those. For Godot I created a root scene and then assembled a few other scenes to make up my parented objects, before I added them to the root scene alongside some other assets to create my level scene.



Instancing Comparison:

Instancing across engines was relatively similar, they just had different forms across the engines. The main difference was that you can parent in the editor and then create a prefab for Unity, you create a blueprint and then parent within it for Unreal, and create a scene where you can parent assets within it for Godot.



My Pick: If I had to choose an editor to rebuild the level, I think that I would choose Unity. While I am most familiar with Unreal, I find that I like the use of prefabs over blueprints. And as for Godot I liked the packed scenes more than the blueprints, but I am still not fully comfortable working in the engine.
